# My Professional Self-Assessment:
## Discuss how completing your coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio has helped you showcase your strengths, shape your professional goals and values, and prepare to enter or become more employable in the computer science field.
Completing the coursework for this program has allowed me to better understand and appreciate professionalism. I learned the values of proper file naming conventions, tone and formatting throughout my documents, and overall how to properly showcase my skills to potential employers. Throughout my files you will notice they are properly named in order to easily understand what is contained in each, all code files include proper in-line comments which allow future developers to access this information, understand what it is used for and how it works. This 


Summarize and introduce how your artifacts fit together and inform the portfolio as a whole.
