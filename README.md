# CS-499 Repository Breakdown
This Repository houses the following items:
- The Original Artifacts of pet.java and banking.cpp
- A compressed version of my Code Review describing pet.java and banking.cpp
- A Plan explaining these artifacts and how I plan to enhance them
- The Enhanced versions of the above artifacts
  - EnhancedPet.zip is an Android Application including a login/signup and pet check-in systems.
  - EnhancedBanking.zip is a Java version of banking.cpp which includes an encrypted username/password system & a non-hardcoded structure which holds client information
- Narratives explaining the enhancements and the skills I have demonstrated

Note: Though there are only two artifacts, there were a total of three enhancements performed for this course. This is shown by the three narrative files.

# My Professional Self-Assessment:
Completing the coursework for this program has allowed me to better understand and appreciate professionalism. I learned the values of proper file naming conventions, tone and formatting throughout my documents, and overall how to properly showcase my skills to potential employers. 
Throughout my files you will notice they are properly named in order to easily understand what is contained in each, all code files include proper in-line comments which allow future developers to access this information, understand what it is used for and how it works. Thus, this practice helps promote my skills of collaborating within a team environment. Moreover, my work that is written within each narrative allows stakeholders to easily be communicated with as I took my technical skills and presented them in a way that is easy to understand for a non-technical audience.  

Throughout my first (and third) artifact's enhancement (pet.java) I showcased my work in both software engineering, databases, and security. I both designed and created an android application essentially from nothing but the idea of a pet check-in service which includes user-friendly UI that also upholds android application standards, databases for both the pet and user that are separate, but still linked to one another, and created a secure, encrypted login/sign-up system. 
My second artifact's (banbking.cpp) enhancement upholds the topics of both data structures and algorithms, as well as security. I switched the original language over to Java in order to showcase my understanding of java hashing algorithms, which I used to encrypt the username and password systems. Moreover, I upgraded the previously hardcoded algorithm which held the client's information, into an arraylist which allows a user to easily input new client information from the main menu. 
As a whole, these enhancements showcase my abilities in keeping a secure mindset throughout development, creating user-friendly applications which anyone should be able to use, and my skills in promoting and explaining this information to non-technical users.
